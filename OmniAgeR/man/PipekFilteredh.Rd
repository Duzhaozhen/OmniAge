\title{Pipek's Filtered Horvath Epigenetic Clock (272 CpGs)}
\usage{
PipekFilteredh(beta.m)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta.m}{A numeric matrix of DNA methylation beta values.
\strong{Rows must correspond to samples and columns to CpGs.}
\code{rownames} (sample IDs) and \code{colnames} (CpG probe IDs) are required.
The matrix should not contain \code{NA} values.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predicted biological ages. The vector is
named using the sample IDs from the \code{rownames} of \code{beta.m}.
}
\description{
Implements the "filtered H (272)" epigenetic clock model proposed by Pipek and Csabai (2023).
This model restricts feature selection to the subset of CpG sites from the original Horvath
pan-tissue clock that are also present on the EPIC array.
}
\details{
Implements the "filtered H (272)" model. Unlike the full ElasticNet model, this clock was trained
by limiting candidate features to the intersection of original Horvath probes and the
cross-platform (27K/450K/EPIC) probe set.

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{272 CpGs:} A subset of the original Horvath clock, re-optimized for better EPIC array compatibility.
\item \strong{Best for:} Datasets pre-filtered to Horvath clock probes but requiring updated calibration.
}

\strong{Input Requirements:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Complete Data:} Missing values must be imputed.
\item \strong{Normalization:} Recommended.
}

Internally applies Horvath's (2013) log-linear age transformation.
