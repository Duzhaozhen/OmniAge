\title{Calculate CHIP-related Methylation Scores}
\usage{
CompCHIP(nbeta.m)
}
\arguments{
\item{nbeta.m}{A numeric matrix of normalized DNA methylation data (e.g.,
beta values from BMIQ). Rows must be CpG probes (with rownames matching
the IDs in \code{chipCpG.lv}) and columns must be samples.}
}
\value{
A list of the same length as \code{chipCpG.lv}. Each element is a numeric
vector containing the calculated CHIP score for each sample (in the same
order as the columns of \code{nbeta.m}).
}
\description{
Computes CHIP (Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential) scores
based on predefined CpG signatures and a normalized DNA methylation matrix.
}
\details{
For each CHIP signature (e.g., DNMT3A, TET2), it identifies common CpGs, calculates Z-scores for each
probe across all samples, and then computes the score as:
(Mean Z-score of positive probes) - (Mean Z-score of negative probes).

Probes with zero variance across samples are excluded.
