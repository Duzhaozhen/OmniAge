\usage{
listEpiAge()
}
\value{
A named list where each name is a clock category (e.g., "mitotic",
"chronological") and each value is a character vector of clock names in
that category.
}
\description{
Returns a named list containing the names of all individual clocks
implemented in the \code{EpiAge} function, grouped by their functional category.
This is useful for knowing which strings are valid for the \code{clock_names}
argument.
