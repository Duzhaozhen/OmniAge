\title{Calculate EnsembleAge Epigenetic Clocks}
\usage{
EnsembleAge(beta.m, clock_version = "HumanMouse", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta.m}{A numeric matrix of methylation beta values.
\strong{Rows must correspond to CpG probes} (e.g., \code{cg00000165}) and
\strong{columns to samples} (e.g., \code{GSM990532}). Rownames (CpG IDs) and
colnames (Sample IDs) are required.}

\item{clock_version}{A character string specifying which version of the
EnsembleAge clocks to calculate. Valid options are \code{"Dynamic"}, \code{"Static"},
or \code{"HumanMouse"}. Default is \code{"HumanMouse"}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical flag. If \code{TRUE} (the default), the function will
print status messages during calculation, including messages from the
internal \code{calculateLinearPredictor} function.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} where each element is a named numeric vector of predicted values.
The names of the list elements correspond to the specific sub-clocks
calculated (e.g., \code{HumanMouse_HumanMouse}, \code{Static_Static}, etc.).
}
\description{
Calculates epigenetic age using the EnsembleAge multi-clock framework
(Haghani et al., 2025). This function computes one of the three available
clock versions (Static, Dynamic, or HumanMouse) by loading the
pre-calculated coefficients from the \code{EnsembleAgeCoef} package data object.
}
\note{
\strong{Understanding the \code{clock_version} output:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{"Static"} and \code{"HumanMouse"}:} The returned values are the final,
calibrated age predictors. The \code{"HumanMouse"} clock returns age
normalized by maximum species lifespan.
\item \strong{\code{"Dynamic"}:} This option returns a list of predictors from all
40 clocks in the 'Dynamic' ensemble library. To complete the full
"EnsembleAge.Dynamic" \emph{methodology} as described in the paper,
the user must perform \strong{additional steps}:
\enumerate{
\item Have a dataset with control and intervention groups.
\item Use the returned 40 predictors to find "responsive" clocks
(e.g., those with |Z-score| > 2 between groups).
\item Calculate the final \code{EnsembleAge.Dynamic} value by taking the
\strong{median} of only those responsive clocks.
This function provides the necessary \emph{basis} for this calculation.
