\usage{
StochClocks(data.m, ages.v = NULL, refM.m = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.m}{A numeric matrix of normalized DNAm beta values.
\strong{Rows must be CpGs and columns must be samples.} Rownames must be
CpG identifiers (e.g., "cg00000029") and colnames must be
sample identifiers.}

\item{ages.v}{(Optional) A numeric vector of chronological ages for the
samples. Must be the same length as the number of columns in \code{data.m}.
If provided, this will be used to calculate EAA and IAA. (Default: \code{NULL})}

\item{refM.m}{(Optional) A reference matrix for cell-type deconvolution
(e.g., from the \code{EpiDISH} package, such as \code{centEpiFib.m}).
If provided (along with \code{ages.v}), this will be used to calculate
Intrinsic Age Acceleration (IAA). (Default: \code{NULL})}

\item{verbose}{A boolean (default: \code{TRUE}). If \code{TRUE}, the function will
print status messages during calculation, such as the number of
CpGs found for each clock.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{mage}: A list of three numeric vectors (StocH, StocP, StocZ)
containing the predicted DNAm ages for each sample.
\item \code{eaa}: A list of three numeric vectors containing the Extrinsic
Age Acceleration (EAA) residuals, calculated as the residuals from
\code{lm(mage ~ ages.v)}. This list will be empty if \code{ages.v} is \code{NULL}.
\item \code{iaa}: A list of three numeric vectors containing the Intrinsic
Age Acceleration (IAA) residuals, calculated as the residuals from
\code{lm(mage ~ ages.v + estimated_cell_fractions)}. This list will be
empty if \code{ages.v} or \code{refM.m} is \code{NULL}.
\item \code{estF}: A matrix of estimated cell-type proportions as
returned by \code{EpiDISH::epidish}. This will be \code{NULL} if \code{refM.m}
is \code{NULL}.
}
}
\description{
Calculates DNAm-Age estimates based on one of three stochastic epigenetic
clocks (StocH, StocZ, StocP). These are stochastic analogues of the
Horvath, Zhang, and Levine/PhenoAge clocks, respectively.

They consist of the same CpGs as the original clocks but were trained on
artificial cohorts generated via a stochastic process of age-related DNAm
change accrual. Although built using sorted monocyte samples from the
MESA study, their predictive ability is largely independent of immune
cell type or whole blood, as the DNAm data is standardized prior to
clock application.

The stochastic clocks may serve as a useful complement to the original clocks,
providing a method to assess if specific age-acceleration patterns
(or decelerations) could be driven by an underlying stochastic process.
This may offer insights into the biological mechanisms of phenotypes
linked to epigenetic age acceleration.

\details{
This function relies on the \code{glmStocALL} data object. It assumes that
the command \code{data("glmStocALL")} will load a list object named
\code{glmStocALL.lo}, which contains the three fitted \code{glmnet} models.

\examples{
# Load example data
download_OmniAgeR_example("Hannum_example")
load_OmniAgeR_example("Hannum_example")
# hannum_bmiq_m is a matrix: CpGs (rows) x Samples (columns)
# Hannum_example_pheno is a dataframe with an 'Age' column

# Calculate clocks with age acceleration
StochClocks.out <- StochClocks(hannum_bmiq_m,
                               ages.v = PhenoTypesHannum_lv$Age)
