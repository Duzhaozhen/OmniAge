\title{Impute and Append Missing CpGs for Clock Analysis}
\usage{
PCClocks_impute_DNAm(DNAm, method = c("mean"), CpGs = NULL, subset = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{DNAm}{A numeric matrix of DNA methylation (beta) values.
Rows must be samples and columns must be CpG IDs.}

\item{method}{The imputation method for missing (NA) values.
Currently, only "mean" is supported.}

\item{CpGs}{A named numeric vector where names are the required CpG IDs
and values are their default (e.g., population mean) beta values.}

\item{subset}{A logical value. If TRUE (default), NA imputation is
only applied to the intersection of CpGs in \code{DNAm} and \code{CpGs}.
If FALSE, it is applied to all CpGs present in \code{DNAm}.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix, subsetted to the CpGs specified in \code{CpGs},
with all missing values and missing columns imputed.
}
\description{
Pre-processes a DNA methylation matrix for clock analysis by handling
both missing values (NA) and entirely missing CpGs.
}
\details{
This function performs two key operations:
\enumerate{
\item Imputes missing values (NA) within existing CpGs using the specified method.
\item Appends any CpGs required by the clock that are absent from the
input matrix, filling them with the provided default values from \code{CpGs}.
}
}
